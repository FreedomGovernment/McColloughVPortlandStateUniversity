This is a live authoring session for a lawsuit against Portland (Oregon) State University and the Freedom Cookbook, a guide to the proliferation of Freedom around the world. In this live stream, I will enlighten you to a little known Supreme Court case in 2001 called Troxel vs Granville, a landmark third-party child custody and visitation ruling where the Court ruled that for the State or anyone else to abridge someone's First Amendment right, in this case to the care and control of their child, the State must use a proceeding to abridge the right and there is a Clear and Convincing Evidence Requirement, and the State has the burden of proof that the there is a detrimental circumstance and the State is required to show it is using the minimum possible intervention to eliminate the detrimental circumstance. Most people think this only applies to Child custody, but this is false. It 100% applies to all First Amendment Rights, else it wouldn't be a right. This right does not end when you step on State property, to the contrary, on State property is when this right is maximally preserved. I will show you that Portland State University has been depriving, and did deprive me, of our First Amendment rights without the use of Clear and Convincing Evidence.

Parents also to have the right to care and control of their children, and this right does not stop when you are 18. If the parents are paying for the College tuition then the parents have a right to decide which classes their child takes. This is going to cause some major problems for the Universities.
